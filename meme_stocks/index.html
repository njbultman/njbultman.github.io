  <h3>Crypto, Meme Stocks, and a Diversified Portfoio</h3>
  <div class="light-text">

<div class="blog">
    <p>2021 has sure been an exciting one in the markets. It seems every month there is something that makes me take a second glance at my phone. From Bitcoin rising above $60K to Gamestop rising to almost $350 per share, there are plenty of examples that always make you question "what if I had just invested a big chunk of my savings prior to these big jumps?" I will admit, when I see these headlines as well, I ask myself the same questions, and it makes me feel I missed something big. However, I always remember to take a step back, remember what I learned in college as a finance major, and trust the time-tested strategy for successful investing: a diversified portfolio. Below walks through my thoughts on investing in cryptocurrency and meme stocks like Gamestop and how that compares to just investing in a diversified portfolio. </p>
<h5>Cryptocurrency</h5>
<p>Currently, I am not a huge fan of cryptocurrency. There are two main reasons for this: Extreme hindsight bias and the fact that it has no entity backing its use.</p>
<p>How rich would you be if you invested in Bitcoin back in 2010? I never remember, but it is a lot. When people think like this, it always seems like the answer was so obvious and that you were a fool to not invest in it. However, this is hindsight bias at its finest. It is so obvious to look in the past and say that you should have invested in something, but in the moment the answer is anything but trivial. Think about this right now. Bitcoin is currently floating around $40K. In a week if it goes up, you are going to say that you were a fool for not investing, but that thought surely will not cross your mind if it drops more. That is why whenever I hear facts like this, I always attribute it to hindsight bias and move on. The same analogy could be applied to any stock, but it appears this is very strong in cryptocurrency, possibly because of its wicked returns in short periods of time. This also creeps into survivorship bias - we see the cryptocurrencies that were successful now but we do not see the ones that failed.</p>
<p>Another point that really makes me feel skeptical about cryptocurrencies is that they are not backed by any entity, which does not make me confident it will succeed as a legitimate currency. If someone were to steal all the Bitcoin I had, could I trust an entity to recover it all? The government is not backing it, and neither are any banks or credit unions. In other words, it appears I would be out of luck (which is very different than if someone hacked into my checking account and took my dollars). Now, this may change in the future as more companies adopt cryptocurrency, but until then, I do not want to put my hard earned money at risk (both with investing in cryptocurrency or converting my money directly into it).</p>
<h5>Meme Stocks</h5>
<p>While I do not believe in everything that Wall Street Bets has done, I sure appreciate them banning together to show a "power to the people" approach when it comes to investing. Gamestop proved that the small institutional investor can cause a disruption to some big hedge funds when average people come together with a goal in mind. </p>
<p>Despite this being noteworthy, it was very risky since this was a meme stock, or a stock whose price is driven by a bunch of ordinary investors and not really related to the fundamental indicators (like earnings) that would normally influence the stock price. If you are looking to invest, I recommend steering clear of these unless you are prepared to lose a lot of money. Timing is everything with these, and nobody is perfect at timing the market on when to buy and sell. Just as much as you could buy the dip, you could also buy at the peak. Even though this is fun to do in the moment since you feel like you are a part of something bigger, most of the time you will be on the losing side of this since the meme stock can rise or fall at anytime. Just like with cryptocurrencies not having a large entity backing them, there is not really anything backing the price of a meme stock surge besides a flood of institutional investors ready to "take it to the moon." Do you really want to trust that everyone will buy and hold? Maybe, maybe not. I have a hunch that when it really starts surging, some people will cash out before others, dropping the price. This will continue to happen and then leave others losing money and wondering what happened.</p>
<h5>A Diversified Portfolio</h5>
<p>I am sure many people have heard the saying that "slow and steady wins the race." That saying could not be more applicable when we are comparing a diversified portfolio to straight all-in investments to cryptocurrency or meme stocks. In contrast to Bitcoin or Gamestop, a diversified portfolio usually returns five to seven percent a year as opposed to five or seven percent a day. While this might sound like a huge downside, a major point to remember is that a diversified portfolio is far less riskier. If you invest in a diversified portfolio, just because one stock crashes does not mean your portfolio is ruined. More than likely, another stock has surged, and normally the benefits outweigh the negatives. Continuing this approach 30-40 years down the line will truly make your money work for you.</p>
<p>A diversified portfolio is the time-tested strategy for successful investing (whereas cryptocurrencies and Gamestop/other meme stocks have not been). If there is anyone that would like to learn more about this, I highly encourage you to read "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" by Burton Malkiel. This book does an excellent job of really showing you the power of a diversified portfolio and compound interest. Plus, I created a Kaggle notebook on showing the power of diversification in Python, which can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/njbultman/python-portfolio-diversification-optimization">here</a>. </p>
<h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
<p>Overall, when it comes to my financial future, I will take the time-tested strategy over gambling it on cryptocurrency or meme stocks investing any day of the week, even if that means feeling a little upset when I could have hit it big. While I think an argument could be made on including these within a highly diversified portfolio, it is still something to consider with caution. Just like stocks can go up really fast, they can also go down. As I started this post, always remember to take a step back from the crazy news about cryptocurrencies and meme stocks to reflect on your investment goals and the risks you are willing to take. From there, you can decide the path that is best for you.</p>
