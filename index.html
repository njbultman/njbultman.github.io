<br>
My name is Nick, and I am currently a senior financial analyst at CUNA Mutual Group (CMG) supporting IT. Coming 
from a finance and risk management background through the University of Wisconsin-Madison has allowed me to 
not only grasp difficult quantitative concepts but also explain them to people who have expertise in different realms.
Taking this one step further, after graduation I dived into data science where I expanded my quantitative knowledge 
and ability to explain complex topics to less technical audiences. Most recently, I became a certified data scientist 
through DataCamp, confirming my (1) ability to code and (2) understanding of fundamental data science concepts. <br>
<br>
As someone who enjoys putting all my skills into practice (apart from applying these to my current role at CMG), 
I recently built a fully automated stock trading algorithm in Python that hits the TD Ameritrade API (code is not on GitHub
due to privacy concerns). Currently, it runs every weekday, and I am excited to see its results in comparison to my backtests 
in the near future. If something like this also interests you, I would love to connect and discuss it further. <br>
<br>
While my interest has mostly been focused around finance, risk, and data science, I have also built up my knowledge of
various web development languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.) over the years, and after exploring content on using a Python module 
(Flask) as a back end while seeing some excellent examples online (a big thanks to John Yang for his walkthrough on static 
websites with Frozen Flask, which can be found 
<a href = https://john-b-yang.github.io/flask-website/> here </a>), I created my own 
"resume site" to showcase my skills in a different format than LinkedIn allows. <br>
<br>
Just like I mention on LinkedIn with my Kaggle profile, more work is always being added, so please 
check back often. <br>
<br>
Lastly, note that I do not own the rights to any pictures used on this site (apart from the picture of myself). All pictures 
belong to their respective owners. If there are any concerns, please let me know. <br>
