<h3 class = "post-title"><b>Work Experience</h3>
<p style = font-weight:normal >
        Before and after graduation from the University of 
        Wisconsin-Madison in May 2018, I have held various roles in the
        insurance industry with multiple companies (spanning property/casuality and 
        life/health). This includes an internship position supporting various areas 
        in claims and full-time positions in corporate finance and investments. This has all
        led me to my current role as a data scientist at the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB).

<h6 class = "post-title"><i>Data Scientist, Intermediate: Dec. 2023 - Present (Madison, WI)</i></h6>
<p style = font-weight:normal>
    Stepping into my first role as a data scientist, my main focus has been on building out
    solutions for end users to easily grab data from the data warehouse, which comprises
    various sources through the years as systems are transitioned on and off. Each of these
    sources contain their own intracies and reside in their own schemas, which is why a large
    effort was put in to develop a unified data model, which is a custom architecture that blends
    the data in these schemas into a holistic framework that allows users to easily see similar metrics
    across systems.

    Examples include:
    <li style = "color:#c8d1d9; font-weight:normal">
