        Certified Data Scientist (Apr. 2021 - Present) <br>
        <br>
        DataCamp is an educational platform that has helped me learn the fundamental 
        programming and data science concepts through a variety of languages (R, Python, SQL, Git, 
        Shell, etc) since May of 2018. <br>
        The link above will take you to my personal profile that gives a glimpse into my completed 
        coursework, completed "career paths" and skill tracks, completed projects that DataCamp offers, 
        and the overall "experience points" that I have gained to show my engagement with the material. 
        To give a flavor of what a course encompasses, they are about four hours in duration (some take 
        a bit longer and some take less) while projects take one to two hours (guided is closer to an 
        hour while unguided takes about two). <br>
        <br>
        Lastly, in April of 2021 I became a Certified Data Scientist by DataCamp. This involved six assessments 
        in R, Python, and SQL, an unguided coding challenge, and a case study where I needed to prepare a technical 
        report and give a presentation to a non-technical audience.
